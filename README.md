1. Basic Network Configuration: My beginner project on Networking on Cisco Packet Tracer. I decided that I would simply make simple projects and explain each of them. So my first project would be a simple network. Each PC is on the same subnet. The topology is as followed.
2. Two layer 2 switches, that will provide connectivity. The switches instead of sending packets based on IP address. They send packets based on MAC addresses.
3. Four end user devices that will communicate with each other within the same network. Each device are connected with Copper Straight-Through Cables.

4. The subnet mask for the network is 255.255.255.0.
5. The network address is 192.168.1.0.
6. The broadcast address is 192.168.1.255.
7. The PC ip addresses need to be different, to avoid conflicts.
8. PC1: 192.168.1.1
9. PC2: 192.168.1.2
10. PC3: 192.168.1.3
11. PC4:192.168.1.4

12. The goal was simple, to connect all devices together and verify the connectivity.
13. To verify the connectivity, you would use the ping command. If there are any issues, there are possibily three issues in the network.
14. Improper cabling, incorrect ip configurations, illogical issues in the network.

15. But what are the real world use cases?
16. This type of setup is basic. Usually found for small office or home networks. It is easy to trouble shoot and easy communication without a router.
Though scalibility would be an issue, as you would need to assign static ip address for each PC.
There are also no traffic segmentation, and ofcourse no way of communicating with external networks. A router would be needed.
